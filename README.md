## 💡 Motivation
Quietfox is designed to simplify and declutter Firefox’s interface, giving users a minimalist browsing experience. By hiding rarely used context menu items and toolbar elements, it reduces distractions and streamlines common workflows.

The style targets Zen-like productivity, making your Firefox environment feel cleaner and more focused without altering core functionality.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. Locate your Firefox profile folder:  
   - Type `about:support` in the address bar.  
   - Click **Open Folder** next to "Profile Folder".  
   - Create a `chrome` folder if it doesn’t already exist.

2. Save this file as `userChrome.css` inside the `chrome` folder.

3. Enable custom stylesheets:  
   - Go to `about:config`  
   - Set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`

4. Optional — enable live editing (for developers/debugging):  
   - Enable `devtools.chrome.enabled` → `true`  
   - Enable `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` → `true`  
   - Open Developer Tools (⌘+⇧+⌥+I on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I on Windows/Linux)  
   - Use the "Style Editor" tab to edit `userChrome.css` live.

5. Restart Firefox to apply the changes.
